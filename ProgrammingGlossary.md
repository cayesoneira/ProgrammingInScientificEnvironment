## A
- **API**: also Rest API
---
## C
- **CLI** (Command Line Interface): every input in the terminal to give any order (petition).
- *Container*: standardized unit of software. The container is totally isolated: that's the power of this system, you don't have to install anything to use it

## S
- **Soft link**:

## V
- **Virtualization**: technology allowing the isolation of processes as they were alone in a bland new computer. The software running in a Virtual Machine is some way to do it, but it requires creating operating systems from scratch, which is a "demandful" process for the computer. Docker alows a similar function, which is running some application as if it was running in another computer, but it does not require the creation of a new OS but only using the Docker Engine.
- **Volume**: a new, special, container created to store information for the moment another container is killed. Of course it has to be accesed by the Docker Engine.
