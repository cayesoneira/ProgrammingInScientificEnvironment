### Glossary
## C
- **Container**: standardized unit of software. The container is totally isolated: that's the power of this system, you don't have to install anything to use it
---
## V
- **Virtualization**: technology allowing the isolation of processes as they were alone in a bland new computer. The software running in a Virtual Machine is some way to do it, but it requires creating operating systems from scratch, which is a "demandful" process for the computer. Docker alows a similar function, which is running some application as if it was running in another computer, but it does not require the creation of a new OS but only using the Docker Engine.
